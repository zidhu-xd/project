## Description
Typing Blaster is a browser-based typing-speed game created with **HTML5 Canvas**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**. The player needs to type words that appear and move across the screen before they reach the left edge. When words are typed correctly, they are removed and the player earns points. Allowing words to pass the left edge costs lives. As the player scores more points, the level goes up and the game gets harder by increasing the speed of the words and how often they appear.

This project demonstrates the application of core programming concepts taught in CS50x, including event handling, DOM manipulation, algorithms for game loops and object management, state persistence (via `localStorage`), and responsive user interface design.

## Features: A typing game that can be played by one person using canvas rendering.
 Words appear in different places and at different speeds.
 Points are awarded according to the length and level of the words.
 Levels are raised every 200 points in the lives and level system.
 - High score persistence through `localStorage`.
 Restart, Mute/Unmute, and Pause/Resume controls.
 Instructions in a clear, responsive user interface.
